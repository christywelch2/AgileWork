### Response

I recently discovered that one of the tools I use frequently in 3D game development was no longer going to be maintained. Aka, nothing new would be rolled out to support the new version of my game engine. How could this be -- something that feels so essential to the forward momentum of game dev, just done for good? I soon found out that this tool was entirely open-source and  primarily developed by a single person, who apparently no longer felt inspired to maintain the system.

This article provides insight as to precisely why something as seemingly surprising as this can occur: consumers of open-source software are not supporting the developers that maintain the very product that they are profiting off of. Because of low-funding and (understandable) developer burnout, developers who have donated years of their lives to these projects are having to throw in the towel despite their passion.
